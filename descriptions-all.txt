Because the score for a movie is usually composed after the film is finished (which is much after trailers are released), a trailer will incorporate music from other sources.

Satire is primarily a literary genre, but it can also be found in the graphic and performing arts. In satire, vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are ridiculed, ideally in order to shame individuals/society into improving. Although satire is usually meant to be funny, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism.  Irony and sarcasm are common elements, but parody, burlesque, exaggeration, juxtaposition, comparison, analogy, and double entendre are also frequently used.
